leaktracer (2.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed XB-Task field from debian/control and use a parameter to
    dh_gencontrol instead, since dpkg-gencontrol messes with the field's
    case (Closes: #305754).
  * Removed g++ from the build-deps, it is essential now.
  * Added debian/watch file - mostly useless since upstream does not put
    version in the tarball name.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1, no change.

leaktracer (2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed manpage SGML markup (CLoses: #223779).
  * Extract manpage generation into its own rule.
  * Prefixed Task: field with XB- in debian/control.

leaktracer (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Use dh-buildinfo.

leaktracer (2.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/info/html/ in manpage (Closes: #194284).
  * Commented out refentryinfo in manpage, since that's not supported by
    the converter.
  * Be sure to remove auxiliary generated files from docbook2man on
    debian/rules clean.  
  * Rebuilt with g++ 3.3.
  * Build with -g -O2 as per current policy, and support "noopt" flag
    instead of "debug".
  * Install the LD_PRELOAD object in a subdir of /usr/lib/, since that's
    not a real full-fledged shared lib (lintian).
  * Use debian/compat; build-deb on debhelper 3.4.4.
  * Updated debian/rules copyright.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.10.

leaktracer (2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt for the g++-3.2 transition.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Jan 2003 10:11:10 +0100

leaktracer (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release (Closes: #141937).
  * Changed Makefile to ease CFLAGS tweeking.
  * Added realclean: target to Makefile.
  * Written a small manpage.  Format it with docbook-utils, as docbook-to-man
    does a wrong job here.
